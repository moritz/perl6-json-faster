#JSON::Faster

Wrote this, originally, for Zef because the `to-json` stuff was running _long_ and after seeing the performance improvement over built-in `to-json` and similar modules, figured I'd release this whale.

##What doesn't it do

This doesn't provide a `from-json`, you can use the built-in for it as that is fast enough; my only pain was converting `to-json`.

##Options

###`Bool :pretty? = True`

Pretty output means you get spacing and line breaks in the out instead of one long string.

###`Int :level? = 0`

The initial level of indenting for the output, 0 will insert 0 spaces before out, 1 will insert `:$spacing` spaces prior to output.  This is unused if `:$pretty` is `False`.

###`Int :spacing? = 2`

Controls how many spaces per `:$level` the output receives when `:$pretty` is `True`.  This is unused if `:$pretty` is `False`.

##Benchmark vs JSON::Fast

Why `JSON::Fast`?  Because its `to-json` performance was roughly equivalent to the built-in.
